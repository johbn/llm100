I was off work today, so I rode my motorcycle to a distant swimming pool. The sun was shining and there were many cars.

After swimming for about an hour, I went to eat ramen noodles. These days I am getting too old to eat much.

In the evening, I cooked dinner for my wife and we watched TV together.
